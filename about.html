            Invest in the future
With True Nature Foundation we are focusing on ecological restoration, rural development and climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration and ‚Äòclimate labs‚Äô to test and multiply nature-based solutions.

We develop projects that sustain the systemic health, resilience and adaptability that maintain ecosystems in a condition where people and wildlife can flourish. New nature-based economic opportunities enable young people to find jobs and stay in their areas. At the same time the project develops important breeding herds of endangered megaherbivores.

We work directly with local communities ‚Äì their local, traditional knowledge is crucial for protecting increasingly fragile landscapes. Technological innovation is crucial too. We are using the latest tools for planning, implementation, monitoring and impact assessment, including GIS, Remote Sensing, trail cameras, sensors, drones and IoT.

Invest in the planet
Nature provides us with around $125 trillion in economic value every year, so it is worth protecting and restoring. Nature also provides vital services at the local, regional and global scales, such as food production, water purification, flood protection and climate-change mitigation. And with biodiversity and ecosystem services worth more in monetary terms than the entire worldwide economy, there‚Äôs a clear business case to be made for investing in ecological restoration.

In every crisis lies an opportunity. Now is our chance to achieve systemic change for more sustainable and resilient economies and societies. Investment in low carbon economic opportunities and nature-based solutions is crucial for a green and just recovery.

You can play a major role in driving this systemic change. 


True Nature Investment
Businesses increasingly intregrate biodiversity and sustainable development into their investment decision-making. Grants and investment enable TNF to channel funds to projects and programmes focused on ecological, social and climate impact.

Invest in our ecological restoration projects:
Financial institutions, entrepreneurs and other investors can invest in activities ranging from reforestation, natural regeneration, trophic rewilding, carbon sequestration to landscape bases approaches, generating benefits that let both people and nature prosper.

Invest in our nature-based business models:
Business action for biodiversity generates new services, products and technologies with reduced impacts on biodiversity and the climate. Driven by changes in consumer awareness and preferences, our projects also promote human health and recreation and create new markets e.g. in ecotourism, organic agriculture and certified sustainable products) and thus and new revenue streams.

            Support Wildlife and Local Communities
            Europe‚Äô wildlife and landscapes need your support. Your gift will go directly to field projects, helping us bring back and protect some of Europe‚Äôs lost and endangered species.
            
            Support highly dedicated conservationists throughout Europe and provide them with the means to protect their natural heritage.
            A healthy environment is the fundamental basis of all life-support systems, including that of human well-being and socio-economic development. True Nature Foundation‚Äôs mission is to combine ecological restoration and conservation to create thriving environments for sustainable development and resilient communities.

            Our goals
Ecosystems provide essential goods and services such as natural resources, fresh water, clean air and healthy soil; they help mitigate natural disasters, including pests and diseases and they help regulate the climate. Contributing to the implementation of the Biodiversity Strategy to 2030 adopted by the European Commission, we aim to restore biodiversity and ecosystem services, developing more sustainable landuse systems and management of natural resources, mitigate climate change, and control invasive alien species. Large-scale restoration of degraded ecosystems and development new nature-based solutions will accelerate transformative change and strengthen vulnerable communities and regions.
